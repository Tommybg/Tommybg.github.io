**`Curious Learner on a mission to help others`**

I am a curious ML Engineer and Content Creator on a mission to develop solutions that positively impact millions ðŸŒŽ, leveraging the power of AI with genuine commitment. My goal is to make this impact a reality, one TOKEN at a time, learning every day and building innovative projects focused on helping others. I prioritize rapid shipping and iteration to gain feedback, learn from mistakes, and listen to the community. Through my Instagram [instagram] and LinkedIn [linkedin], I share educational content about AI and ML in Spanish, addressing the lack of accessible resources in Spanish-speaking countries. I am dedicated to putting LATAM on the map as a hub of talent.
